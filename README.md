## Overview

so first project, 1 week into web dev.. ive dabbled with java previously so syntax work came relativley easy.
for a 'newbie' project it shows i have a very long way to go.
with the QR code challenge i found general concept easy but to do the detailed work definitely flexed my brain muscles.

### What I learned

that i have lots to learn

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

hopefully this is the first stepping stone of many on my career path of web development.

### Useful resources

google.
